# Statistical Tests and Models


## Tests for Exploratory Data Analysis

A collection of functions are available from `scipy.stats`.

+ Comparing the locations of two samples
    - `ttest_ind`: t-test for two independent samples
    - `ttest_rel`: t-test for paired samples
	- `ranksums`: Wilcoxon rank-sum test for two independent samples
	- `wilcoxon`: Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples
+ Comparing the locations of multiple samples
    - `f_oneway`: one-way ANOVA
	- `kruskal`: Kruskal-Wallis H-test
+ Tests for associations in contigency tables
    - `chi2_contingency`: Chi-square test of independence of variables
	- `fisher_exact`:  Fisher exact test on a 2x2 contingency table
+ Goodness of fit
    - `goodness_of_fit`: distribution could contain unspecified parameters
	- `anderson`: Anderson-Darling test 
    - `kstest`: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
	- `chisquare`: one-way chi-square test
	- `normaltest`: test for normality


Since R has a richer collections of statistical functions, we can call 
R function from Python with `rpy2`. See, for example, a [blog on this
subject](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/05/25/calling-r-from-python-with-rpy2/).
