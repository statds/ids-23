    "text": "1.1 What Is Data Science?\nOne widely accepted concept is the three pillars of data science: mathematics/statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge.\nIn her 2014 Presidential Address, Prof. Bin Yu, then President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, gave an interesting definition: \\[\n\\mbox{Data Science} =\n\\mbox{S}\\mbox{D}\\mbox{C}^3,\n\\] where S is Statistics, D is domain/science knowledge, and the three C’s are computing, collaboration/teamwork, and communication to outsiders."

Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).\n\n1.3.1 Command Line Interface\nOn Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.\nOn Windows, several options can be considered.\n\nCygwin (with X): https://x.cygwin.com\nGit Bash: https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash\n\nTo jump start, here is a tutorial: Ubunto Linux for beginners.\nAt least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across directories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.\n\n\n1.3.2 Python\nSet up Python on your computer:\n\nPython 3.\nPython package manager miniconda or pip.\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)\n\nI will be using IPython and Jupyter Notebook in class.\nReadability is important! Check your Python coding styles against the recommended styles: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. A good place to start is the Section on “Code Lay-out”."
