The GitHub repo is at https://github.com/statds/ids-s23. The GitHub repo of the notes from Spring 2022 are available at https://github.com/statds/ids-s22.\nAn interesting quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\n\n\n\n\nVanderPlas, Jake. 2016.

    "text": "4.5 Variables versus Objects\nIn Python, variables and the objects they point to actually live in two different places in the computer memory. Think of variables as pointers to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being those objects. This matters when multiple variables point to the same object.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]  # create a list; x points to the list\ny = x          # y also points to the same list in the memory\ny.append(4)    # append to y\nx              # x changed!\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4813195072\n4813195072\n\n\nNonetheless, some data types in Python are “immutable”, meaning that their values cannot be changed in place. One such example is strings.\n\nx = \"abc\"\ny = x\ny = \"xyz\"\nx\n\n'abc'\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4435201160\n4555419184\n\n\nQuestion: What’s mutable and what’s immutable?\nAnything that is a collection of other objects is mutable, except tuples.\nNot all manipulations of mutable objects change the object rather than create a new object. Sometimes when you do something to a mutable object, you get back a new object. Manipulations that change an existing object, rather than create a new one, are referred to as “in-place mutations” or just “mutations.” So:\n\nAll manipulations of immutable types create new objects.\nSome manipulations of mutable types create new objects.\n\nDifferent variables may all be pointing at the same object is preserved through function calls (a behavior known as “pass by object-reference”). So if you pass a list to a function, and that function manipulates that list using an in-place mutation, that change will affect any variable that was pointing to that same object outside the function.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = x\n\ndef append_42(input_list):\n    input_list.append(42)\n    return input_list\n\nappend_42(x)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 42]\n\n\nNote that both x and y have been appended by \\(42\\)."

Among them, 1 is for sign, 11 is for exponent, and 52 are fraction significand, See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format. The bottom line is that, of course, not every real number is exactly representable.\n\n0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n0.3 - 0.2 == 0.1\n\nFalse\n\n\nWhat is really going on?\n\nimport decimal\ndecimal.Decimal(0.1)\n\nDecimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')\n\n\nBecause the mantissa bits are limited, it can not represent a floating point that’s both very big and very precise. Most computers can represent all integers up to \\(2^{53}\\), after that it starts skipping numbers.\n\n2.1**53 + 1 == 2.1**53\n\n# Find a number larger than 2 to the 53rd\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nx = 2.1**53\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    x = x + 1\nx == 2.1**53\n\nTrue\n\n\nWe add 1 to x by 1000000 times, but it still equal to its initial value, 2.1**53. This is because this number is too big that computer can’t handle it with precision like add 1.\nMachine epsilon is the smallest positive floating-point number x such that 1 + x != 1.\n\nprint(np.finfo(float).eps)\nprint(np.finfo(np.float32).eps)\n\n2.220446049250313e-16\n1.1920929e-07"

Make sure you have clear messages to document the changes.\n\nWrite a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through simulation. The function takes two arguments ndoors and ntrials, representing the number of doors in the experiment and the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors, both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to explain your them.\nWrite a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of \\(\\pi\\). The function takes a Monte Carlo sample size n as input, and returns a point estimate of \\(\\pi\\) and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000.

If not (e.g., zeroes), code them as missing values.\nAre the missing patterns of “ON STREET NAME” and “LATITUDE” the same? Summarize the missing patterns by a cross table. If “ON STREET NAME” and “CROSS STREET NAME” are available, use geocoding to fill the “LATITUDE” and “LONGITUDE”.\nAre ZIP CODE and BOROUGH always missing together? If LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are available, use reverse geocoding to fill the ZIP CODE and BOROUGH.\nPrint the whole frequency table of CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1.
