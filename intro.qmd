# Introduction

## What Is Data Science?

One widely accepted concept is the three pillars of data science:
mathematics/statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge.

In her 2014 Presidential Address, Prof. Bin Yu, then President of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics, gave an interesting definition:
$$
\mbox{Data Science} =
\mbox{S}\mbox{D}\mbox{C}^3,
$$
where S is Statistics, D is domain/science knowledge, and
the three C's are computing, collaboration/teamwork, and communication
to outsiders.


## Expectations from This Course

+ Proficiency in project management with Git.
+ Proficiency in project report with Quarto.
+ Hands-on experience with real-world data science project.
+ Competency in using Python and its extensions for data science.
+ Full grasp of the meaning of the results from data science algorithms.
+ Basic understanding the principles of the data science methods.


## Computing Environment

All setups are operating system dependent. As soon as possible, stay away from
Windows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).

### Command Line Interface

On Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.

On Windows, several options can be considered.

+ Cygwin (with X): <https://x.cygwin.com>
+ Git Bash: <https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash>

To jump start, here is a tutorial:
[Ubunto Linux for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).

At least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across directories.

### Python

Set up Python on your computer:

- Python 3.
- Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)

Readability is important!
Check your Python coding styles against the recommended styles:
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>. A good place to start if the Section on
"Code Lay-out".
